Cogs121 Assignment 2


The application limited the user to only a few options. From the beginning of
the process, it was obvious which links to click on to get to the next step.
Although the process only involved two steps, the process was linear. This
was done by keeping constraints on the web app. I restricted the possible
actions the user can perform by only allowing a login link, then displaying
the data on the bar graph. Using constraints, the app prevented the user
from moving away from the point of the app, which is to display his/her
friends birthdays on a bar graph.

On the screen that displays the bar graph with the birthday data, the user has
an option to click on a button that organizes the bars from highest to lowest.
The bars organize instantly so the user gets feedback from the app which is
important so the the user knows what has been done. This type of feedback
works because it is immediate and synchronized with what the user clicks.
Also, when the user clicks on the box again it does the opposite. After
this, the user should have a good idea to what the button does.
